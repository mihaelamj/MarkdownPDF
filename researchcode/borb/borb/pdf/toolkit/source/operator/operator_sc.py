"""
The 'sc' operator: Set the non-stroking color using the current color space.

The 'sc' operator is used in a PDF content stream to set the non-stroking color for subsequent
painting operations. The color is specified using the current color space, which may be
either a device-dependent color space (e.g., DeviceRGB or DeviceCMYK) or a device-independent
color space (e.g., CIE-based color spaces).

The 'sc' operator applies to non-stroking operations, meaning it affects how areas are
filled (for example, with the 'f', 'F', or 'B' operators), but not how paths are stroked.

The color values provided must match the currently selected non-stroking color space,
and the operator requires the appropriate number of operands for that space (e.g., 1 for
grayscale, 3 for RGB, or 4 for CMYK).

Note:
    The 'sc' operator only affects the non-stroking color and does not impact stroking
    operations. The color set by this operator is stored in the graphics state and remains
    in effect until changed by another non-stroking color operator (e.g., 'scn' for
    non-stroking color with a specified color space). For more information on the
    graphics state and color management in PDF, refer to section 4.5 of the PDF specification.

        Initialize the 'sc' operator.

        This operator requires access to the active rendering Source because
        the number and interpretation of operands depend on the currently
        selected non-stroking color space in the graphics state.

        The Source instance provides access to:
        - The current graphics state
        - The active non-stroking color space
        - Validation context for operand count and color component semantics

        Since the 'sc' operator does not explicitly specify a color space
        (it uses the one already set in the graphics state), it must query
        the Source at execution time to determine how many operands are
        expected (e.g., 1 for DeviceGray, 3 for DeviceRGB, 4 for DeviceCMYK,
        or a color-space-defined component count for other spaces).
